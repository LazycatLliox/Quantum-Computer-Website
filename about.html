        <p class="info">While classical computers rely on binary bits (zeros and ones) to store and process data, quantum computers can encode even more data at once using quantum bits, or qubits, in superposition.</p>

        <p class="info">A qubit can behave like a bit and store either a zero or a one, but it can also be a weighted combination of zero and one at the same time. When combined, qubits in superposition can scale exponentially. Two qubits can compute with four pieces of information, three can compute with eight, and four can compute with sixteen.</p>

        <p class="info">However, each qubit can only output a single bit of information at the end of the computation. Quantum algorithms work by storing and manipulating information in a way inaccessible to classical computers, which can provide speedups for certain problems.</p>

        <p class="info">As silicon chip and superconductor development has scaled over the years, it is distinctly possible that we might soon reach a material limit on the computing power of classical computers. Quantum computing could provide a path forward for certain important problems.</p>
